Governance dApp for DAOs

Governance plays an important role when it comes to DAOs. In the whole community there will be people who want the DAO to succeed, there will also be some malicious actors. It is important to make sure that the people who are voting have best interest in their mind. 

<h2>Proposal</h2><br />
All the users who want to take part in the governance of the DAO have to stake their tokens. Anyone who has more than a certain number of tokens will be able to propose an idea. This number shouldn't be too high, it should just be high enough to prevent spams. 
The voting power will be determined by 2 factors: number of tokens being staked and the amount of time the tokens are being staked for. Let's assume that the maximum number of days a user can stake token is 365 days and minimum staking period is 30 days. If a person stakes token for 30 days voting power will be '1 * number of tokens staked'. If a person stakes the token for 365 days, then on the last day the voting power will be '12 * number of tokens staked'.  In this case there is a chance that some users with huge number of tokens will end up with huge voting power. To mitigate that issue, only first 'x' number of tokens being locked should get this voting power multiplier, after the 'x' number of tokens, next slab should get half the voting power as the previous slab and so on. This diminishing voting power multiplier will encourage more users to stake their tokens, rather than just whales. 
(There can also be something like an NFT raffle after which some users who staked their tokens for governance get some NFT as prize.)

<h2>Workflow</h2>
1. A user who holds more than a certain number of tokens staked for atleast a month proposes an idea.<br />
2. All users who have staked their tokens for atleast a month can vote for this. Let the period of voting be 5 days.<br />
3. Voting power will be decided by the concepts discussed above.<br />
4. A user can also delegate their vote to any other user who has certain amount of voting power.<br />
5. After 5 days the result of the proposal will be announced.<br />
